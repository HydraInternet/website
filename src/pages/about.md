## Our Why

The future of technology is heading in a bleak direction. We've gone from a
libertarian's dream of free, open information to a platform that is designed to
surveil, manipulate, and control.

Something as important as the internet should not be controlled by the few. The
people have created the internet; corporations are just squatters trying to
monitise our hard work.
